# WPF.Launcher
Allow you make new WPF application faster.
To make new application, you just develop your business logic based on MVVM.

In this launcher, we used [Caliburn.Micro](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/) as MVVM framework.

We also used some 3rd libraries for User Interface.
* [Material Design In XAML](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/)
* [MPropertyChanged.Fody](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged)
* [ControlzEx](https://github.com/ControlzEx/ControlzEx)
